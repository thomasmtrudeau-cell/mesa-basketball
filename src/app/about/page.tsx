            WHY MESA EXISTS
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-5 text-brown-200 leading-relaxed text-[17px]">
            <p>
              I built Mesa out of a genuine love for the game and a deep commitment to helping others grow through it.
              Training has always been a passion of mine, something I poured myself into throughout my playing career
              and beyond. Long before Mesa had a name, I was in the gym during offseasons, working with players,
              refining my craft as a trainer, and developing an approach that was intentional, creative, and results-driven.
            </p>
            <p>
              What started as a passion grew into a program. Mesa is rooted in the same community I grew up in, and
              that connection matters deeply to me. This is not a program built from a distance. It is built from the
              same courts, the same neighborhoods, and the same hunger to be great.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over five years and hundreds of athletes later, from 4-year-olds picking up a ball for the first time
              to adult professionals sharpening their edge, Mesa has become a place where real development happens.
              Not shortcuts. Not gimmicks. Just consistent, intentional work that produces results on and off the court.

            PLAYING CAREER
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-5 text-brown-200 leading-relaxed text-[17px] mb-8">
            <p>
              I competed as a point guard at the Division I level, suiting up for two of college basketball&apos;s
              most storied programs: St. John&apos;s University and Butler University, both members of the prestigious
              Big East Conference. Competing in one of the most demanding conferences in the country, I trained
              alongside and against elite talent day in and day out, developing a deep understanding of the game
              at its highest collegiate level.
            </p>
            <p>
              I went on to continue my career professionally in Greece, gaining firsthand experience in European
              professional basketball, a system known for its emphasis on skill, IQ, and fundamentals. That
              combination of American Division I intensity and European technical discipline is the foundation
              every Mesa session is built on.
