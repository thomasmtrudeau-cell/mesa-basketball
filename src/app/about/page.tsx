            WHY MESA EXISTS
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-5 text-brown-200 leading-relaxed text-[17px]">
            <p>
              Mesa Basketball Training was born out of a genuine love for the game and an even greater passion for
              helping others grow through it. After competing at the Division I level at two of the most prestigious
              programs in the country and playing professionally in Europe, Artemios Gavalas came home with one
              clear mission: give back everything the game gave him.
            </p>
            <p>
              What started as a commitment to getting in the gym with players who truly wanted to improve has grown
              into something much bigger. Mesa is rooted in the same community Artemios grew up in — and that
              connection matters deeply. This isn&apos;t a program built from a distance. It&apos;s built from the
              same courts, the same neighborhoods, and the same hunger to be great.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over five years and hundreds of athletes later — from 4-year-olds picking up a ball for the first
              time to adult professionals sharpening their edge — Mesa has become a place where real development
              happens. Not shortcuts. Not gimmicks. Just consistent, intentional work that produces results on and
              off the court.

            PLAYING CAREER
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-5 text-brown-200 leading-relaxed text-[17px] mb-8">
            <p>
              Artemios competed as a point guard at the Division I level, suiting up for two of college
              basketball&apos;s most storied programs — St. John&apos;s University and Butler University, both
              members of the prestigious Big East Conference. Competing in one of the most demanding conferences
              in the country, he trained alongside and against elite talent day in and day out, developing a
              deep understanding of the game at its highest collegiate level.
            </p>
            <p>
              He went on to continue his career professionally in Greece, gaining firsthand experience in
              European professional basketball — a system known for its emphasis on skill, IQ, and
              fundamentals. That combination of American Division I intensity and European technical discipline
              is the foundation every Mesa session is built on.

            THE APPROACH
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-5 text-brown-200 leading-relaxed text-[17px]">
            <p>
              Great trainers don&apos;t just run drills — they teach the game. At Mesa, every session is
              thoughtfully designed with creativity and purpose. The goal isn&apos;t to go through the
              motions; it&apos;s to understand <em>why</em> each skill matters and how it translates to live
              game situations. That kind of intentional training is what separates players who look good in
              drills from players who perform when it counts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Artemios brings a point guard&apos;s mind to every session — reading situations, making
              adjustments, and finding the right way to connect with each athlete individually. Whether
              working with a beginner or a seasoned player, the energy in the gym stays high, the
              expectations stay real, and the creativity keeps players engaged and progressing.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the lessons go beyond basketball. Dedication, consistency, showing up when it&apos;s hard,
              and chasing your goals with discipline — these are values that carry athletes far beyond the
              court and into every area of their lives. Mesa is committed to developing people, not just
              players.
